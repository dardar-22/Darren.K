        Hello! My name is Darren and I am a final year Higher Nitec Electronic
        Engineering student at ITE College Central. My fascination for computers
        and programming was sparked when I was nine years old, when my dad
        introduced me to Scratch. Scratch is a programming enviroment that uti-
        lizes a drag and drop visual programming system. Scratch introduced me
        to the idea of sprites and methods. It taught me that computers can pro-
        duce output with given structure and instructions. I experimented and pro-
        grammed basic stuff and I would often view premade projects and look at
        the code and modify it. I made many games and animations with Scratch.
        However, that was not enough and I needed to learn more. I picked up
        Python in secondary school and played around with it. For my computer
        science class we were required to create a project using Python. I made
        an encryption and decryption software employing a Ceaser cipher as well
        as obfuscation. I really enjoyed Python as it challanged me to be more
        creative and think abstractly. I gained an interest in low-level programming
        as I got into Linux. That made me want to learn more about computer architectures, 
        operating system concepts and data structures. I then started
        to learn C and NASM. NASM and C were very challanging but allowed me
        to learn more about how computers work. I am still learning C and made
        various mini programs with it.
