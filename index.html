      <p>
        Hello! My name is Darren and I am a Higher Nitec student at ITE College central. I am currently a second year student in electronic engineering.
        My pation is in computers and programming. My facination for programming started when I was 9 years old. It all started when my dad introduced me to Scratch.
        Scratch is a programming enviroment that utilizes a drag and drop visual programming system. Scratch introduced me to the idea of sprites and methods. It thought me that computers can produce
        things by following instructions given to them. This is when I started to experiment and programed basic stuff. I would often veiw premade projects and look at the code and modify them. I made many game and animations with scratch.
        However, that was not enough I needed to learn more. I picked up Python in secondary school and played around with it. For my computer science class we were required to create a project using python. I made an encryption and decryption software employing a ceaser cipher as well as obfuscation.
        I really enjoyed Python as I challanged me to be more creative and think abstractly. I gained an intrest in lowlevel programming as I got into Linux. That mad me want to learn more about computer architecture, operating system concepts and data structures.
        I started to learn C and NASM. NASM and C were very challenging but allowed me to learn more about how computers work. I am still learning C till this day and made various miniprogrames with it.
