        Hello! My name is Darren and I am a final year Higher Nitec Electronic Engineering student at ITE College Central. My fascination for programming and computers started when I was 9 years old, when my dad introduced me to Scratch.
        Scratch is a programming environment that utilizes a drag and drop visual programming system. Scratch introduced me to the idea of sprites and methods. It taught me that computers can produce
        output with given structures and instructions. I experimented and programmed basic stuff and I would often view premade projects and look at the code and modify it. I made many games and animations with Scratch.
        However, that was not enough I needed to learn more. I picked up Python in secondary school and played around with it. For my computer science class we were required to create a project using Python. I made an encryption and decryption software employing a Ceaser cipher as well as obfuscation.
        I really enjoyed Python as it challanged me to be more creative and to think abstractly. I gained an intrest in low-level programming as I got into Linux. That made me want to learn more about computer architectures, operating system concepts and data structures.
        I then started to learn C and NASM. NASM and C were very challenging but allowed me to learn more about how computers work. I am still learning C and made various mini programs with it.
